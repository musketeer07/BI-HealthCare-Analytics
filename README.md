<h1>üè• Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI</strong> project repository! In this case study, you'll step into the shoes of a data consultant for a fictional company, <strong>HealthStat</strong>, to explore a real-world dataset and uncover insights on hospital efficiency. The project aims to identify performance outliers, analyze factors influencing patient length of stay and cost per patient discharge, and ultimately provide actionable recommendations to improve hospital operations.</p>

<h2>üìñ Overview</h2>

<p>The healthcare industry constantly seeks ways to improve efficiency while ensuring high-quality care. In this project, you'll use <strong>Power BI</strong> to analyze hospital performance, focusing on key metrics such as <strong>length of stay</strong> and <strong>cost per patient discharge</strong>. You'll perform exploratory data analysis, build a robust data model, and develop a 3-page branded report with advanced visualizations to share key insights with stakeholders.</p>

<h2>üìä Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset used for this project includes various features related to hospital operations, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hospital ID</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Patient Demographics</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Length of Stay</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cost per Patient Discharge</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Hospital Efficiency Ratings</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Other relevant hospital performance metrics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset is anonymized to ensure privacy while providing rich information for analysis.</p>

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Setup</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To get started, ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Power BI Desktop</strong> installed on your machine. You can download it from <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Power BI official website</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic knowledge</strong> of DAX functions, data modeling, and Power BI visuals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to Run the Analysis</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Clone this repository to your local machine:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/username/healthcare-powerbi-analysis.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Open <strong>Power BI Desktop</strong> and import the dataset (<code>healthcare_data.csv</code>) provided in this repository.</li>
    <li>Create a data model by loading the dataset into Power BI and establishing relationships between tables if necessary.</li>
    <li>Follow the DAX formulas provided in the <code>DAX_Queries.pbix</code> file to perform the required calculations.</li>
    <li>Develop a 3-page Power BI report using the <strong>Key Influencers</strong> and other advanced visuals.</li>
    <li>Share your insights and recommendations by exporting the report as a PDF or sharing it through the Power BI service.</li>
</ol>

<h2>üìå Business Requirements</h2>

<p>The key business objectives for this analysis are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Identify performance outliers</strong>: Find hospitals that are significantly underperforming or excelling in terms of patient care and operational efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Understand factors influencing length of stay and cost per discharge</strong>: Use Power BI's <strong>Key Influencers</strong> visual and other techniques to determine the most impactful variables.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide actionable insights</strong>: Develop a clear set of recommendations based on the analysis to help hospitals improve their overall efficiency and patient outcomes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>üìà Visualization and Dashboard</h2>

<p>The final deliverable for this project is a <strong>3-page branded Power BI report</strong>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Page 1</strong>: Overview of hospital performance, with key metrics such as length of stay and cost per discharge.</li>
    <li><strong>Page 2</strong>: Key Influencers visualization to show the factors driving patient care costs and length of stay.</li>
    <li><strong>Page 3</strong>: Recommendations and actionable insights for hospital administrators to improve efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Visuals Used:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Key Influencers</strong>: Analyze what factors are influencing hospital performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Bar and Line Charts</strong>: Compare performance across multiple hospitals.</li>
    <li><strong>KPIs</strong>: Display high-level metrics for quick decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Branding</strong>: A professional look and feel, tailored for HealthStat stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
